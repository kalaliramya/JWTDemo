JWTDemo â€” JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication using Entity Framework Core:

This project demonstrates how to implement JWT-based authentication in a .NET Core API using Entity Framework Core. Itâ€™s designed for developers who want to understand and build real-world authentication logic used in modern backend applications.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure Overview

ðŸ”¹ Controllers

AuthController: Handles API routes related to user authentication.

Includes logic to restrict API access using [Authorize] attributes and token validation.

ðŸ”¹ DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

Contains models such as UserLoginDto to accept username and password input for authentication.

ðŸ”¹ JWT Repository

Implements a method to generate JWT tokens using a secret key from the configuration.

Encodes claims and signing credentials securely.

ðŸ”¹ AppSettings.json

Stores configuration values like the JWT secret key, issuer, and audience used during token generation and validation.

ðŸš€ Features

Secure token-based authentication.

Configurable secret key and expiration time.

Follows clean, modular architecture (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository).
